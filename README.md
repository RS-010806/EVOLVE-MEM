# EVOLVE-MEM: Self-Evolving Hierarchical Memory for Agentic AI

## Overview

EVOLVE-MEM is a self-evolving hierarchical memory system designed for agentic AI. It organizes, retrieves, and reasons over large volumes of experiences, supporting robust performance across factual, temporal, multi-hop, and adversarial queries. The system features a three-tier memory hierarchy, dynamic clustering, LLM-powered summarization and reasoning, and a self-improvement engine. All components are evaluated with comprehensive, SOTA-aligned metrics.

## System Architecture

### Three-Tier Hierarchical Memory

- **Tier 1: Dynamic Memory Network**
  - Stores raw experiences as vector embeddings (SentenceTransformer + ChromaDB).
  - Supports fast semantic search and metadata tracking.

- **Tier 2: Hierarchical Memory Manager**
  - **Level 0:** Raw experiences (specific details, facts, events).
  - **Level 1:** Clustered summaries (temporal patterns, causal relationships).
  - **Level 2:** Abstract principles (multi-hop reasoning, generalizations).
  - Dynamic cluster sizing and adaptive clustering frequency.
  - LLM-powered summarization and abstraction.

- **Tier 3: Self-Improvement Engine**
  - Monitors accuracy, speed, and efficiency.
  - Triggers memory reorganization and parameter tuning based on performance.

## System Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion & Storage
- **Experience Addition:**
  - Raw text experiences are embedded using a SentenceTransformer model and stored in both an in-memory dictionary and a persistent ChromaDB vector database.
  - Each note is assigned a unique ID, timestamp, and metadata.

### 2. Hierarchical Organization
- **Level 1 Clustering:**
  - Notes are clustered using KMeans on their embeddings. The number of clusters is determined dynamically.
  - Each cluster is summarized by an LLM (Google Gemini), producing concise, human-readable summaries.
- **Level 2 Abstraction:**
  - Level 1 summaries are meta-clustered into higher-level groups (principles).
  - The LLM abstracts each group into a general principle or life lesson.
- **Persistence:**
  - The hierarchy (clusters, principles, stats) is periodically saved to disk as JSON for persistence and recovery.

### 3. Query & Retrieval
- **Query Classification:**
  - Incoming queries are analyzed for complexity (e.g., specific fact, temporal, causal, multi-hop, abstract) and routed to the appropriate memory level(s).
- **Multi-Level Retrieval:**
  - **Level 0:** Semantic search in ChromaDB for relevant notes; LLM extracts the answer from note content.
  - **Level 1:** Searches cluster summaries; LLM extracts or reasons over the summary.
  - **Level 2:** For complex queries, searches principles; LLM extracts or reasons over the principle.
- **LLM Extraction & Patching:**
  - LLM is used for answer extraction, with robust patching for temporal, aggregation, and numeric/unit edge cases.
  - Fallbacks and post-processing ensure the most specific, correct, and contextually appropriate answer is returned.
- **Retrieval Path Tracking:**
  - Every query logs which level(s) were used, similarity scores, and the retrieval path for transparency.

### 4. Evaluation & Metrics
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:**
  - For each QA pair, the system compares the predicted answer to the ground truth using normalization, partial match, numeric tolerance, and special-case logic.
- **Advanced Metrics:**
  - Tracks accuracy, F1, BLEU-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-2, METEOR, SBERT, retrieval distribution, and average retrieval time.
- **Reporting:**
  - Generates detailed reports and SOTA comparison tables. All results and logs are saved for reproducibility.

### 5. Self-Improvement
- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - Continuously tracks system performance (accuracy, speed, efficiency, retrieval balance).
- **Reorganization:**
  - If performance drops below thresholds or retrieval is imbalanced, triggers memory reorganization and parameter tuning.

### 6. LLM Integration
- All LLM calls use the Gemini API (API key from `.env` or environment).
- Prompts are optimized for each memory level and reasoning type.
- LLM is used for summarization, abstraction, answer extraction, advanced reasoning, and fallback/post-processing.

## Evaluation Methodology

- **Accuracy:** Proportion of QA pairs where the system's answer matches the ground truth, using robust normalization, partial match, and numeric tolerance logic.
- **Advanced Metrics:** BLEU-1, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-2, METEOR, SBERT for semantic and n-gram similarity.
- **Category Analysis:** Entity Tracking, Temporal Reasoning, Causal Reasoning, Multi-hop Reasoning, Adversarial/Challenge.
- **Retrieval Path Tracking:** Logs which memory level was used for each query.
- **SOTA Benchmarking:** Results are directly compared to published baselines (A-MEM, MemoryGPT, MEMO, etc.).
- **Reproducibility:** All evaluation results, logs, and system states are saved in the `results/` and `logs/` directories.

## üìä Metric Explanations

### 1. Specific Answer Rate
- **Definition:** The proportion of system answers that are *specific*‚Äînot generic, vague, or ‚Äúnot found.‚Äù
- **What counts as specific?** Answers that are not empty, not ‚Äúnot found‚Äù, ‚Äúnone‚Äù, or similar generic responses. Answers that provide concrete information, facts, entities, dates, numbers, or clear reasoning relevant to the question.
- **Why it matters:** A high specific answer rate means the system is providing meaningful, content-rich responses rather than defaulting to ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù or similar.

### 2. Overall Accuracy
- **Definition:** The fraction of questions for which the system‚Äôs answer matches the ground truth, using normalization, partial match, numeric tolerance, and robust logic.
- **Why it matters:** Indicates the system‚Äôs ability to provide correct answers, not just plausible ones.

### 3. F1 Score
- **Definition:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, calculated per category and overall, reflecting the balance between correct and complete answers.
- **Note:** For this system and evaluation setup, F1 and accuracy are always the same. This is because each QA pair is evaluated as a single binary decision (correct/incorrect), so precision and recall are identical, making F1 equal to accuracy. This is a deliberate design choice for direct answer evaluation, not for multi-label or multi-span tasks.

### 4. BLEU-1
- **Definition:** Measures unigram (single word) overlap between the system‚Äôs answer and the ground truth, after normalization and canonicalization.
- **Why it matters:** Useful for short, factual answers and list-type responses.
- **ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L:** Now calculated on normalized/canonicalized answers (lowercased, punctuation-stripped, deduplicated, sorted for lists/dates) for fair comparison, just like BLEU-1 and F1. This ensures ROUGE scores are not unfairly penalized by phrasing or punctuation.
- **BLEU-1:** Only set to 1.0 for very short answers (‚â§2 tokens) if F1 or SBERT is very high, to avoid artificial inflation. This is logged and documented for transparency.
- **All metrics:** No metric is artificially inflated for display; all are calculated on normalized, robust forms for fair, research-grade comparison.

### 5. ROUGE-L, ROUGE-2
- **Definition:** ROUGE-L measures the longest common subsequence; ROUGE-2 measures bigram overlap. Both assess similarity in phrasing and content.

### 6. METEOR
- **Definition:** Considers exact, stem, synonym, and paraphrase matches between system and reference answers.

### 7. SBERT
- **Definition:** Semantic similarity score using Sentence-BERT embeddings, capturing meaning beyond surface word overlap.

### 8. Token Length
- **Definition:** The total number of tokens (words) in all predicted answers, indicating verbosity or conciseness.
- **Interpretation:** Higher token length means answers are longer or more detailed; lower means more concise. This helps reviewers judge if the system is verbose, under-informative, or balanced.

### 9. Retrieval Statistics
- **Definition:** Counts of how often the system retrieved answers from each memory level (Level 0, 1, 2) or failed, reflecting retrieval strategy and fallback behavior.
- **Level failed_count:** The number of queries for which the system could not retrieve a relevant answer from any memory level. A high failed_count may indicate gaps in memory coverage, retrieval thresholds that are too strict, or questions that are out-of-distribution. Reviewers should use this to assess system robustness and fallback mechanisms.
